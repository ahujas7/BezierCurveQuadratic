# BezierCurveQuadratic

This Bézier Curve model creates a parabolic curve with three control points: P0, P1, and P2, respectively. The points may be translated across the screen and the curve will be manipulated accordingly. 

The curve begins at point P0 and ends at point P2. This is specific to a Bézier Curve of second order (n = 2). In general, the curve always begins at P0 and ends at Pn. The remaining points in between behave as 'magnets', pulling the curve towards them.
